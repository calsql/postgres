The following illustrates the agreed upon coding style for any and all SQL
committed to the ACH tool:
1) Have your editor convert tabs to spaces
2) Set a modeline as the last line of your file (example below)
3) use the <> operator instead of the != operator
4) spaces around your operators, pls
    e.g. foo * bar, not foo*bar
5) spaces after commas
    e.g. (a, b), not (a,b)
6) always include the closing ;
7) run tools/pg_format against your code!

*) more to come, I'm sure
